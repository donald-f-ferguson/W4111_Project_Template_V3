### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.<br><br>
2. Open the project in PyCharm. The course instructions strongly recommended using PyCharm. Create and activate
a new python virtual environment.
If you are not using PyCharm, you are on your own.

You can review the [online instructions.](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-virtual-environment.html)
   2. Open a terminal window in the PyCharm.
   3. Run the command ```pip freeze > requirements.txt```.

3. Navigate inside the project explorer to ```interactive_app/application```  and select the file ```main.py```.<br><br>
4. Right click and choose ```Run main.py```.<br><br>
5. You should see a window activate in PyCharm that will eventually display something similar to<br>
<img src="./assets/app-server-starts.jpg"><br><br>
6. In a browser, enter ```localhost:8001/docs``` in the navigation bar. You should see something that
looks like<br>
<img src="./assets/open-api-home.jpg">

Congratulations! You have unlocked the next level. You can close the browser window/tab and stop the
application in PyCharm.
